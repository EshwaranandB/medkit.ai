    "summary": "<h3>What is leukemia?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/leukemia.html\">Leukemia</a> is a term for cancers of the blood cells. Leukemia starts in blood-forming tissues such as the bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes the cells which will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Each type of cell has a different job:</p><ul>\n<li>White blood cells help your body fight infection</li>\n<li>Red blood cells deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/plateletdisorders.html\">Platelets</a> help form clots to stop bleeding</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells and make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work.</p>\n\n<h3>What is acute myeloid leukemia (AML)?</h3> \n<p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of acute leukemia. \"Acute\" means that the leukemia usually gets worse quickly if it's not treated. In AML, the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets. When the abnormal cells crowd out the healthy cells, it can lead to infection, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/anemia.html\">anemia</a>, and easy bleeding. The abnormal cells can also spread outside the blood to other parts of the body.</p>\n\n<p>There are several different subtypes of AML. The subtypes are based on how developed the cancer cells are when you get your diagnosis and how different they are from normal cells.</p> \n\n<h3>What causes acute myeloid leukemia (AML)?</h3>\n<p>AML happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells. The cause of these genetic changes is unknown. However, there are certain factors that raise your risk of AML.</p>\n\n<h3>Who is at risk for acute myeloid leukemia (AML)?</h3>\n<p>The factors that raise your risk of AML include:</p><ul>\n<li>Being male</li>\n<li>Smoking, especially after age 60</li>\n<li>Having had <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cancerchemotherapy.html\">chemotherapy</a> or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/radiationtherapy.html\">radiation therapy</a></li>\n<li>Treatment for <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/acutelymphocyticleukemia.html\">acute lymphoblastic leukemia</a> (ALL) as a child</li>\n<li>Exposure to the chemical benzene</li>\n<li>A history of another blood disorder such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/myelodysplasticsyndromes.html\">myelodysplastic syndrome</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>What are the symptoms of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)?</h3>\n<p>The signs and symptoms of AML include:</p><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/fever.html\">Fever</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/breathingproblems.html\">Shortness of breath</a></li>\n<li>Easy <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/bruises.html\">bruising</a> or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/bleedingdisorders.html\">bleeding</a></li>\n<li>Petechiae, which are tiny red dots under the skin. They are caused by bleeding.</li>\n<li>Weakness or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/fatigue.html\">feeling tired</a></li>\n<li>Weight loss or loss of appetite</li>\n<li>Bone or joint pain, if the abnormal cells build up near or inside the bones</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>How is acute myeloid leukemia (AML) diagnosed?</h3>\n<p>Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose AML and figure out which subtype you have:</p><ul>\n<li>A physical exam</li>\n<li>A medical history</li>\n<li>Blood tests, such as a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/complete-blood-count-cbc/\">complete blood count (CBC)</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/blood-smear/\">blood smear</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/bone-marrow-tests/\">Bone marrow tests</a>. There are two main types - bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy. Both tests involve removing a sample of bone marrow and bone. The samples are sent to a lab for testing.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetictesting.html\">Genetic tests</a> to look for gene and chromosome changes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you are diagnosed with AML, you may have additional tests to see whether the cancer has spread. These include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/diagnosticimaging.html\">imaging tests</a> and a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/cerebrospinal-fluid-csf-analysis/\">lumbar puncture</a>, which is a procedure to collect and test cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).</p>\n\n<h3>What are the treatments for acute myeloid leukemia (AML)?</h3>\n<p>Treatments for AML include:</p><ul>\n<li>Chemotherapy</li>\n<li>Radiation therapy</li>\n<li>Chemotherapy with <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/stemcells.html\">stem cell transplant</a></li>\n<li>Other anticancer medicines</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Which treatment you get often depends on which subtype of AML you have.\nTreatment is usually done in two phases:</p><ul>\n<li>The goal of the first phase is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow. This puts the leukemia into remission. Remission means that the signs and symptoms of cancer are reduced or have disappeared.</li> \n<li>The second phase is known as post-remission therapy. Its goal is to prevent a relapse (return) of the cancer. It involves killing any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"\">NIH: National Cancer Institute</p>",

The lymphatic system clears away infection and keeps body fluids in balance. The adenoids and tonsils work by trapping germs coming in through the mouth and nose.</p>\n \n<p>Adenoids usually start to shrink after about age 5. By the teenage years, they are almost completely gone. By then, the body has other ways to fight germs.</p>\n \n<h3>What are enlarged adenoids? </h3>\n\n<p>Enlarged adenoids are adenoids that are swollen. It is a common problem in children.</p>\n \n<h3>What causes enlarged adenoids?</h3> \n\n<p>Your child's adenoids can be enlarged, or swollen, for different reasons. It may just be that your child had enlarged adenoids at birth. Adenoids can also become enlarged when they are trying to fight off an infection. They might stay enlarged even after the infection is gone.</p>\n \n<h3>What problems can enlarged adenoids cause?</h3>\n\n<p>Enlarged adenoids can make it hard to breathe through the nose.

To check the size of your child's adenoids, your provider may use:</p><ul>\n<li>A special mirror in the mouth</li>\n<li>A long, flexible tube with a light (an endoscope)</li>\n<li>An <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/xrays.html\">x-ray</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>What are the treatments for enlarged adenoids?</h3>\n\n<p>The treatment depends on what is causing the problem. If the symptoms are not too bad, your child may not need treatment. If treatment is needed, your child may get nasal spray to reduce the swelling or antibiotics if the provider thinks that there is a bacterial infection.</p>\n  \n<p>In some cases, your child may need an adenoidectomy.</p>\n\n<h3>What is an adenoidectomy and why might I my child need one?</h3>\n\n<p>An adenoidectomy is surgery to remove the adenoids. The provider may recommend this surgery if:</p><ul>\n<li>Your child has repeated infections of the adenoids. Sometimes the infections can also cause ear infections and fluid buildup in the middle ear.</li>\n<li>Taking antibiotics doesn't get rid of a bacterial infection of the adenoids.</li>\n<li>The enlarged adenoids block the airways.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If there is also a problem with the tonsils, your child will probably have a tonsillectomy (removal of the tonsils) at the same time that the adenoids are removed.</p>\n\n<p>After having the surgery, your child usually goes home the same day. Your child will probably have some throat pain, bad breath, and a runny nose. It can take several days to feel all better.</p>",

Drinking less is better for your health than drinking more. Also, there are some people who should not drink at all.</p>\n\n<p>If you are going to drink, it's important to know how alcohol affects you and how much is too much.</p>\n\n<h3>How does alcohol affect the body?</h3>\n<p>Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant. This means that it is a drug that slows down brain activity. It can change your mood, behavior, and self-control. It can cause problems with memory and thinking clearly. Alcohol can also affect your coordination and physical control.</p>\n\n<p>Alcohol also has effects on the other organs in your body. For example, it can raise your blood pressure and heart rate. If you drink too much at once, it could make you throw up.</p> \n\n<h3>Why are the effects of alcohol different from person to person?</h3>\n<p>Alcohol's effects vary from person to person, depending on a variety of factors, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How much you drink</li>\n<li>How often you drink</li>\n<li>Your age</li>\n<li>Your sex</li>\n<li>Your genetics</li>\n<li>Your overall health</li>\n<li>Whether or not you have a family history of alcohol problems</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>What is moderate drinking?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For most women, moderate drinking is no more than 1 standard drink a day</li>\n<li>For most men, moderate drinking is no more than 2 standard drinks a day</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Even though moderate drinking may be safe for many people, there are still risks. Moderate drinking can raise the risk of death from certain cancers and heart diseases.</p>\n\n<h3>What is a standard drink?</h3>\n<p>In the United States, a standard drink is one that contains about 14 grams of pure alcohol, which is found in:</p><ul>\n<li>12 ounces of regular beer (5% alcohol content)</li>\n<li>5 ounces of wine (12% alcohol content)</li>\n<li>1.5 ounces or a \"shot\" of distilled spirits or liquor (40% alcohol content)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Who should not drink alcohol?</h3>\n<p>Some people should not drink alcohol at all, including those who:</p><ul>\n<li>Are in recovery from an <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/alcoholusedisorderaud.html\">alcohol use disorder</a> (AUD)</li>\n<li> Are are unable to control the amount they drink</li>\n<li>Are <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/underagedrinking.html\">under age 21</a></li>\n<li>Are <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/pregnancyandsubstanceuse.html\">pregnant</a> or trying to become pregnant</li>\n<li>Are taking medicines that can interact with alcohol</li>\n<li>Have medical conditions that get can worse if you drink alcohol</li>\n<li>Are planning on driving</li>\n<li>Will be operating machinery or doing activities that require skill, coordination, and alertness</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you have questions about whether it is safe for you to drink, talk with your health care provider.</p>\n\n<h3>What is excessive drinking?</h3>\n<p>Excessive drinking includes binge drinking and heavy alcohol use:</p><ul>\n<li>Binge drinking is drinking so much at once that your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level is 0.08% or more: \n  <ul>\n  <li>For men, this usually happens after having 5 or more drinks within a few hours.</li>\n  <li>For women, it is usually after about 4 or more drinks within a few hours.</li> \n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li>Heavy alcohol use means:\n  <ul>\n  <li>For men, having more than 5 drinks on any day or more than 15 drinks per week.</li>\n  <li>For women, having more than 4 drinks on any day or more than 8 drinks per week.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Binge drinking raises your risk of injuries, car crashes, and alcohol overdose.

Your risk of developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD) depends on how much, how often, and how quickly you drink alcohol. Alcohol misuse means that drinking causes distress and harm. Over time alcohol misuse can increase your risk of AUD.</p> \n\n<p>AUD can range from mild to severe, depending on the symptoms. Severe AUD is sometimes called alcoholism or alcohol dependence.</p>  \n\n<p>AUD is a disease that causes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Craving - a strong need to drink</li>\n<li>Loss of control - not being able to stop drinking once you've started</li>\n<li>Negative emotional state - feeling anxious and irritable when you are not drinking</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>What is binge drinking?</h3>\n<p>Binge drinking is a type of alcohol misuse. It means drinking so much at once that your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level is 0.08% or more. For a man, this usually happens after having 5 or more drinks within a few hours. For a woman, it is after about 4 or more drinks within a few hours. Not everyone who binge drinks has an AUD, but they are at higher risk for getting one.</p>\n\n<h3>What are the dangers of too much alcohol?</h3>\n<p>Too much alcohol is dangerous. Heavy drinking can increase the risk of certain cancers. It may lead to <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/liverdiseases.html\">liver diseases</a>, such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/fattyliverdisease.html\">fatty liver disease</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cirrhosis.html\">cirrhosis</a>. It can also cause damage to the brain and other organs. Drinking during pregnancy can <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/fetalalcoholspectrumdisorders.html\">harm your fetus</a>. Alcohol also increases the risk of death from car crashes, injuries, homicide, and suicide.</p>\n\n<h3>How do I know if I have an alcohol use disorder (AUD)?</h3>\n<p>You may have an AUD if you can answer yes to two or more of these questions:</p>\n\n<p>In the past year, have you:</p>\n<ul> \n<li>Ended up drinking more or for a longer time than you had planned to?</li>\n<li>Wanted to cut down or stop drinking, or tried to, but couldn't?</li>\n<li>Spent a lot of your time drinking or recovering from drinking?</li>\n<li>Felt a strong need to drink?</li>\n<li>Found that drinking - or being sick from drinking - often interfered with your family life, job, or school?</li>\n<li>Kept drinking even though it was causing trouble with your family or friends?</li>\n<li>Given up or cut back on activities that you enjoyed just so you could drink?</li>\n<li>Gotten into dangerous situations while drinking or after drinking? Some examples are driving drunk and having unsafe sex.</li>\n<li>Kept drinking even though it was making you feel depressed or anxious? Or when it was adding to another health problem?</li>\n<li>Had to drink more and more to feel the effects of the alcohol?</li>\n<li>Had withdrawal symptoms when the alcohol was wearing off?

    "summary": "<h3>What is an alcohol use disorder?</h3>\n\n<p>An <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/alcoholusedisorderaud.html\">alcohol use disorder </a>(AUD) is drinking that causes distress and harm. It is a medical condition in which you:</p><ul>\n<li>Drink alcohol compulsively</li>\n<li>Can't control how much you drink</li>\n<li>Feel anxious, irritable, and/or stressed when you are not drinking</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>An AUD can range from mild to severe, depending on the symptoms. Severe AUD is sometimes called alcoholism or alcohol dependence.</p>\n\n<h3>What are the treatments for alcohol use disorder?</h3>\n\n<p>Most people with an alcohol use disorder can benefit from some form of treatment. Medical treatments include medicines and behavioral therapies. For many people, using both types gives them the best results. People who are getting treatment for AUD may also find it helpful to go to a support group such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). If you have an AUD and a mental illness, it is important to get treatment for both.</p>\n\n\n<p>Some people may need intensive treatment for AUD. They may go to a residential treatment center for rehabilitation (rehab). Treatment there is highly structured. It usually includes several different kinds of behavioral therapies. It may also include medicines for detox (medical treatment for alcohol withdrawal) and/or for treating the AUD.</p>\n\n<h3>Which medicines can treat alcohol use disorder?</h3>\n\n<p>Three medicines are approved to treat AUD:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Disulfiram</strong> causes unpleasant symptoms such as nausea and skin flushing whenever you drink alcohol. Knowing that drinking will cause these unpleasant effects may help you stay away from alcohol.</li>\n<li><strong>Naltrexone</strong> blocks the receptors in your brain that make you feel good when you drink alcohol. It can also reduce your craving for alcohol. This can help you cut back on your drinking.</li>\n<li><strong>Acamprosate</strong> helps you avoid alcohol after you have quit drinking. It works on multiple brain systems to reduce your cravings, especially just after you have quit drinking.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Your health care provider can help you figure out if one of these medicines is right for you. They are not addictive, so you don't have to worry about trading one addiction for another. They are not a cure, but they can help you manage AUD. This is just like taking medicines to manage a chronic disease such as asthma or diabetes.</p>\n\n<h3>Which behavioral therapies can treat alcohol use disorder?</h3>\n\n<p>Another name for behavioral therapies for AUD is alcohol counseling. It involves working with a health care professional to identify and help change the behaviors that lead to your heavy drinking.:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Cognitive-behavioral therapy</strong> (CBT) helps you identify the feelings and situations that can lead to heavy drinking. It teaches you coping skills, including how to manage stress and how to change the thoughts that cause you to want to drink. You may get CBT one-on-one with a therapist or in small groups.</li>\n<li><strong>Motivational enhancement therapy</strong> helps you build and strengthen the motivation to change your drinking behavior. It includes about four sessions over a short period of time. The therapy starts with identifying the pros and cons of seeking treatment. Then you and your therapist work on forming a plan for making changes in your drinking. The next sessions focus on building up your confidence and developing the skills you need to be able to stick to the plan.</li>\n<li><strong>Marital and family counseling</strong> includes spouses and other family members. It can help to repair and improve your family relationships. Studies show that strong family support through family therapy may help you to stay away from drinking.</li>\n<li><strong>Brief interventions</strong> are short, one-on-one or small-group counseling sessions. It includes one to four sessions. The counselor gives you information about your drinking pattern and potential risks. The counselor works with you to set goals and provide ideas that may help you make a change.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Is treatment for alcohol use disorder effective?</h3>\n\n<p>For most people, treatment for an AUD is helpful. But overcoming an alcohol use disorder is an ongoing process, and you may relapse (start drinking again). You should look at relapse as a temporary setback, and keep trying. Many people repeatedly try to cut back or quit drinking, have a setback, then try to quit again. Having a relapse does not mean that you cannot recover. If you do relapse, it is important to return to treatment right away, so you can learn more about your relapse triggers and improve your coping skills. This may help you be more successful the next time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">NIH: National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</p>",

If you have this condition, your body doesn't make enough alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT).</p>\n\n<p>AAT is made by your liver. It helps protect your lungs from inflammation and irritating substances you might breathe in, such as smoke. If your liver doesn't make enough AAT, your lungs may be more easily damaged from <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/smoking.html\">smoking</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/airpollution.html\">pollution</a>, or dust from the environment. This can lead to a serious lung condition called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/copd.html\">COPD</a>). AAT deficiency may also cause a liver disease called <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cirrhosis.html\">cirrhosis</a>. This is more common in children who have AAT deficiency.</p>\n\n<h3>What causes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency)?</h3>\n<p>AAT deficiency is a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/geneticdisorders.html\">genetic disorder</a>. That means it's caused by changes in your genes, which may also be called gene variants or mutations.</p>\n \n<p>Your genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. AAT deficiency is caused by changes in the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/serpina1/\"><em>SERPINA1</em> gene</a>, which carries instructions for making the AAT protein. These gene changes are inherited from your parents, so AAT deficiency tends to run in families:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>If you have two mutated copies of the gene,</strong> it means you have a condition called AAT deficiency. People with this disorder have a higher risk of getting lung disease or liver damage before the age of 45.</li>\n<li><strong>If you have one mutated copy of the gene,</strong> you are a carrier of AAT deficiency. In these cases, this means you are at slightly higher risk of developing lung disease, especially if you have other risk factors, such as being a smoker. You could still pass the mutated gene on to your children.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are a few gene changes that cause AAT deficiency. These gene changes can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Decrease the amount of AAT protein your liver makes.</li>\n<li>Prevent your liver from making any AAT.</li>\n<li>Affect the shape of the AAT protein so that it can't move out of your liver to protect your lungs. Over time, AAT builds up in your liver and causes damage.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>What are the symptoms of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency)?</h3>\n<p>Some people who have AAT deficiency do not have any symptoms. For those who do, symptoms usually appear in people between 20 and 50 years old. These symptoms may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wheezing</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/breathingproblems.html\">Shortness of breath</a>, especially after exercise</li>\n<li>Chronic <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cough.html\">cough</a> with phlegm (mucus)</li>\n<li>Repeated respiratory infections such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/commoncold.html\">colds</a> and the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/flu.html\">flu</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/chestpain.html\">Chest pain</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/fatigue.html\">Fatigue</a></li>\n<li>Faster-than-normal heartbeat when you stand up</li>\n<li>Vision problems</li>\n<li>Losing weight without trying</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some people who have AAT deficiency may have liver damage. Signs of liver damage include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/jaundice.html\">jaundice</a> (a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow) and swelling in your legs.</p>\n\n<p>Rarely, AAT deficiency can cause skin problems, such as painful lumps or patches.</p>\n\n<h3>How is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency) diagnosed?</h3>\n<p>Your health care provider may <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/alpha-1-antitrypsin-test/\">test you for AAT deficiency</a> if you have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Symptoms of AAT deficiency</li> \n<li>A condition that could be related to AAT deficiency</li>\n<li>Relatives who have AAT deficiency</li>\n<li>Relatives who have a lung or liver disease that could be related to AAT deficiency</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>AAT deficiency in babies often affects the liver. Your baby may need AAT testing if he or she has signs of liver disease such as jaundice or abnormal <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/liver-function-tests/\">liver enzyme tests</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A blood test can check the level of AAT protein in your blood. If the level is lower than normal, it is likely that you have AAT deficiency.</p>\n\n<p>A genetic test is the most certain way to check for AAT deficiency and should be done to confirm the results of the blood test. There are two types of genetic tests:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A genotype test looks for the more common types of gene changes that can cause AAT deficiency.</li>\n<li>A phenotype test checks for changes in the AAT protein that change how it would normally work.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If your lungs are affected, you may also have <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/lung-function-tests/\">lung function tests</a> to see how well your lungs are working.</p>\n\n<h3>What are the treatments for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency)?</h3>\n\n<p>There is no cure for AAT deficiency, but there are treatments to help with the symptoms and slow the lung damage it causes. Treatment options may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inhaled medicines to help you breathe better.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/pulmonaryrehabilitation.html\">Pulmonary rehabilitation</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/oxygentherapy.html\">Oxygen therapy</a>.</li>\n<li>Augmentation therapy, which is a lifelong treatment. It raises the levels of the AAT protein in your lungs, using ATT protein taken from the blood of donors. It helps slow down lung damage. It cannot prevent liver damage.</li>\n<li>Lung surgery or a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lungtransplantation.html\">lung transplant</a>, if your lungs are severely damaged.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/livertransplantation.html\">Liver transplant</a>, if your liver is severely damaged.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To help prevent or delay lung damage, it is important to <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/quittingsmoking.html\">quit smoking</a> (if you smoke) and avoid <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/secondhandsmoke.html\">secondhand smoke</a>, dust, and air pollution. Ask your provider If you need to stop drinking alcohol.</p>",

    "summary": "<h3>What is Alzheimer's disease?</h3>\n<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/dementia.html\">dementia</a> among older people. Dementia is a brain disorder that seriously affects thinking and memory skills. If you have AD, it can impair your ability to reason or learn new skills until it becomes difficult to complete daily activities.</p>\n<p>AD begins slowly over many years. It first involves the parts of the brain that control thought, memory, and language. It may be mistaken for normal memory changes with aging. However, AD is not a normal part of aging. The brain changes from the disease lead to symptoms that get worse over time.</p> \n\n<h3>What are the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease?</h3>\n<p>People with AD may have trouble remembering recent events or the names of people they know. Behavior may vary from person to person and day to day. AD progresses in stages. <strong>Late-onset AD</strong> occurs in adults aged 65 and older, which is when most people develop the disease. <strong>Early-onset AD</strong> happens before age 65, which is not common.</p>\n\n<p>Some symptoms of AD can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Getting lost in familiar places</li>\n<li>Repeating the same question</li> \n<li>Not recognizing family members</li>\n<li>Having trouble speaking, reading, or writing</li>\n<li>Not taking care of yourself, such as not bathing or eating poorly</li>  \n</ul>\n\n<p>In AD, over time, symptoms get worse. Later on, people with AD may become anxious or aggressive or wander away from home. Eventually, they need total care. This can cause great stress for family members who must <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/alzheimerscaregivers.html\">care</a> for them.</p> \n\n<h3>Who is more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease?</h3>\n<p>Researchers don't fully understand what causes AD. Age is the biggest risk factor. Your risk is also higher if a family member has had the disease. Although people who develop Alzheimer's don't always have a history of the disease in their families.</p> \n\n<p>Researchers believe the causes of AD may be a combination of age-related changes in the brain, along with genetic, health, and lifestyle factors. Some medical conditions that are associated with a higher risk of AD include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/hearingdisordersanddeafness.html\">Hearing loss</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/depression.html\">Depression</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/mildcognitiveimpairment.html\">Mild cognitive impairment</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/concussion.html\">Concussion</a> or other <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/traumaticbraininjury.html\">traumatic brain injury</a> (TBI)</li>\n</ul>\n \n<p>A related problem, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), causes more memory problems than normal for people of the same age.  Many, but not all, people with MCI will develop AD.</p>  \n\n<h3>How is Alzheimer's disease diagnosed?</h3>\n<p>Some health conditions can cause memory loss or symptoms like AD. Talk with your health care provider if you're having noticeable changes in your memory. To determine if your symptoms are related to AD and not normal aging or another health condition, your provider may:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Review your medical history and any medicines you're taking</li>\n<li>Conduct tests to check your memory, thinking, and problem-solving skills</li>\n<li>Ask about changes in behavior or personality</li>\n<li>Do tests to rule out any medical or mental health conditions</li> \n<li>Refer you to a provider that specializes in caring for older adults</li> \n<li>Recommend a neurologist, a doctor who specializes in treating diseases of the brain and nervous system</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>What are the treatments for Alzheimer's disease?</h3>\n<p>No treatment can stop the disease. However, some medicines may help keep symptoms from getting worse for a limited time.</p>\n\n<h3>Can Alzheimer's disease be prevented?</h3>\n<p>You can't change some risk factors, like your age. But changing certain lifestyle factors may promote your brain health and help you live a healthier lifestyle overall. This can include to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manage chronic health issues such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/highbloodpressure.html\">high blood pressure</a> or hearing loss</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/exerciseandphysicalfitness.html\">Get regular physical activity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/nutrition.html\">Eat a healthy diet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/quittingsmoking.html\">Quit smoking</a> (or don't start)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/healthysleep.html\">Get enough sleep</a></li> \n<li>Develop strong <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/howtoimprovementalhealth.html\">social connections</a></li> \n</ul>\n<p class=\"\">NIH: National Institute on Aging</p>",

For the exam, your provider will insert a lubricated, gloved finger into the lower part of your rectum to feel for lumps or anything else that seems unusual.</li>\n<li><strong>May order tests that examine the anus and rectum,</strong> such as: \n  <ul>\n  <li>An <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/anoscopy/\">anoscopy</a>, an exam of the anus and lower rectum using a short, lighted tube called an anoscope. There is also a type of anoscopy called a high-resolution anoscopy. It uses a special magnifying device called a colposcope along with the anoscope to view these areas.</li>\n  <li>A proctoscopy, a procedure to look inside the rectum and anus using a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens.</li>\n  <li>An endo-anal or endorectal <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/sonogram/\">ultrasound</a>, a procedure in which an ultrasound probe is inserted into the rectum.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>May do a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/biopsy.html\">biopsy</a></strong> during an anoscopy or proctoscopy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>What are the treatments for anal cancer?</h3>\n<p>The treatments for anal cancer include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/radiationtherapy.html\">radiation therapy</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cancerchemotherapy.html\">chemotherapy</a>, and surgery. Which treatment you get will depend on how advanced the cancer is, your overall health, and your preferences.</p>\n\n<h3>Can anal cancer be prevented?</h3>\n<p>You may be able to lower your risk of getting anal cancer by getting an HPV vaccine and not smoking. Contact your provider if you need help <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/quittingsmoking.html\">quitting smoking</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It is currently not known if using condoms can prevent anal HPV infections. But using latex condoms every time you have sex can help prevent HIV, a risk factor for anal cancer. And they also help prevent other <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/sexuallytransmittedinfections.html\">sexually transmitted infections</a> (STIs). If your or your partner is <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/latexallergy.html\">allergic to latex</a>, you can use polyurethane condoms.</p>\n\n<p>If you are an adult with HIV, it's important to get an anal cancer screening every year. The screening checks for anything that seems unusual, such as lumps, burning, and precancer cells (cells that could turn into cancer). The screening will include a digital rectal exam. If anything unusual is found, you will have an anoscopy or high resolution anoscopy.</p>",

    "summary": "<h3>What is angioplasty?</h3>\n<p>Angioplasty is a procedure to improve blood flow in coronary arteries that have become narrow or blocked. Your coronary arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart. If you have <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/coronaryarterydisease.html\">coronary artery disease</a>, a sticky material called plaque builds up in your coronary arteries. Plaque is made of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cholesterol.html\">cholesterol</a>, calcium, and other substances in your blood. Over time, it can narrow your arteries or fully block them. When this happens, some parts of your heart don't get enough blood.</p> \n<p>Angioplasty widens the blocked part of your artery so more blood can get through. It is also called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).</p><p>\n\n</p><h3>What conditions does angioplasty treat?</h3>\n<p>Doctors (usually a heart specialist called a cardiologist) use angioplasty to:</p>\n<ul> \n<li><strong>Reduce <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/chestpain.html\">chest pain</a> from blockages in the coronary arteries.</strong> This type of pain is called <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/angina.html\">angina</a>. There are different types of angina.

To help <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventheartdisease.html\">prevent more plaque blockages</a>, you'll need to take any prescribed medicines, eat healthy foods, and get <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/howmuchexercisedoineed.html\">regular exercise</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>What happens during angioplasty?</h3>\n<p>Most people have angioplasties in a hospital in a special room called a cardiac catheterization, or cath, lab. You will be awake and lying down. You'll get medicine to help you relax through an intravenous (IV) line. This is a small tube that goes into a vein in your hand or arm.</p>\n\n<p>Angioplasty is done through a blood vessel in your arm, wrist, or groin. Your doctor will:</p>\n<ul> \n<li>Make a small opening in that area to insert a thin tube (a catheter) into a blood vessel.</li> \n<li>Thread the tube through the vessel to your heart, using <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/xrays.html\">x-rays</a> as a guide.</li>\n<li>Inject contrast dye inside your arteries. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the x-rays.</li> \n<li>Replace the first tube with another one that has a small, deflated balloon on the end.</li>\n<li>Guide the balloon inside the blockage and inflate it to push the plaque flat against the artery wall. This makes the artery wider and improves blood flow.</li>\n<li>Sometimes put a small, mesh tube into the artery to help keep it open. The tube is called a stent. Some stents have a coating of medicine that helps prevent <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/bloodclots.html\">blood clots</a> from forming.</li> \n</ul>\n\n<h3>What happens after an angioplasty?</h3>\n<p>If you had an angioplasty for chest pain, you'll go to a recovery room for a few hours. You may stay in the hospital overnight. Your doctor will probably prescribe <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/bloodthinners.html\">medicines to prevent blood clots</a>.
